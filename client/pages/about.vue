        A few words about us
      </h2>
      <p>
        <b>Secret</b> is an open source tool
        <b>made by privacy freaks for privacy freaks</b>,
        letting you send encrypted notes that will
        be self-destruct after being read.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Notes are stored encrypted on our servers and can only
        be accessed using the decryption key, which
        is binded to the shareable note URL. Secret
        does not have the link, at no time is any note
        held in any readable format state at Secret.
        This assures that nobody (including Secret's
        administrators) can read a note. When a note
        is retrieved, its data is completely removed
        from Secret; there is absolutely no way to
        recover it again.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Secret sysadmin team will do as much as possible to
        protect the site against unauthorized access,
        modification or destruction of the data. But,
        even if someone or something could manage to
        gain access to the database, they would be
        unable to read the notes since their contents
        are
        <b>encrypted and can't be decrypted without the
          links
        </b> which Secret never has a hold of.
